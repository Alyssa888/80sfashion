                <h2>Baseball jacket</h2>
                <p>Baseball jackets, also known as varsity jackets, were inspired by the American college student style.
                    Their popularity evolved as more and more people on sport fields wanted to have it. Eventually, it
                    became a fashion must-have. The jackets usually had team initials, bold color combinations, and
                    often showcased a wearer's love for sports. The jackets related to a particular sport or school. The
                    way to wear them was to pair them with denim skirts or jeans, tracksuits, and high-top sneakers. A
                    more ‘polished’ look could be created with khaki pants, loafers and a button-down shirt or a polo.

                <h2>Windbreaker</h2>
                <p>Consisting of lightweight, water-resistant material and vibrant color schemes, windbreakers were not
                    just functional; they were a fashion statement that seamlessly blended athleticwear with
                    street-style flair. While their main purpose was to protect against wind and light rain, they turned
                    an irresistible piece of clothing, thanks to their bold colors, geometric patterns, and often
                    oversized silhouettes. You could combine them with matching tracksuit bottoms or ones in a whole
                    different color. Fanny packs, worn around the waist, became a functional and stylish addition,
                    emphasizing the 80s trend for rocking bold accessories.</p>

                <h2>Bodywarmer</h2>
                <p>Easily recognizable by their bold colors and contrasting panels, bodywarmers were worn to stay warm
                    and to look fashionable at the same time. Whether it was styled with a matching tracksuit set or
                    mixed and matched with vibrant colors, the bodywarmer created a sporty look. Not only was it worn
                    casually, but it was also worn for fitness or aerobics occasions. For people who liked a preppy
                    touch, bodywarmers could also be styled over sweaters or turtlenecks. And of course, accessories
                    such as headbands and high-top sneakers completed the look.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Levi fur lined jacket</h2>
                <p>This jacket quickly became an essential addition to outerwear. The rugged denim style combined with
                    the warm inside became very popular among both women and men. The addition of a cozy lining elevated
                    the classic denim jacket, making sure to be a good fit for people seeking both style and warmth.
                    They were often styled with a pair of high-waisted jeans, (again pairing denim with denim) creating
                    a coordinated denim look that is everything except boring.</p>
