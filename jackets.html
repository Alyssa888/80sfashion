                <h2>Levi fur lined jacket</h2>
                <p>This jacket quickly became an essential addition to outerwear. The rugged denim style combined with the warm inside became very popular among both women and men. The addition of a cozy lining elevated the classic denim jacket, making sure to be a good fit for people seeking both style and warmth. They were often styled with a pair of high-waisted jeans, (again pairing denim with denim) creating a coordinated denim look that is everything except boring.

Whether it was styled with a matching tracksuit set or mixed and matched with vibrant colors, the bodywarmer created a sporty look. Not only was it worn casually, but it was also worn for fitness or aerobics occasions. For people who liked a preppy touch, bodywarmers could also be styled over sweaters or turtlenecks. And of course, accessories such as headbands and high-top sneakers completed the look.

            <h2>Baseball</h2>
        <p>Baseball jackets, also known as varsity jackets, were inspired by the American college student style. Their popularity evolved as more and more people on sport fields wanted to have it. Eventually, it became a fashion must-have. The jackets usually had team initials, bold color combinations, and often showcased a wearer's love for sports. The jackets related to a particular sport or school. The way to wear them was to pair them with denim skirts or jeans, tracksuits, and high-top sneakers. A more ‘polished’ look could be created with khaki pants, loafers and a button-down shirt or a polo.

            <h2>Windbreaker</h2>
            <p>Consisting of lightweight, water-resistant material and vibrant color schemes, windbreakers were not just functional; they were a fashion statement that seamlessly blended athleticwear with street-style flair. While their main purpose was to protect against wind and light rain, they turned a irresistible piece of clothing, thanks to their bold colors, geometric patterns, and often oversized silhouettes. You could combine them with matching tracksuit bottoms or ones in a whole different color. Fanny packs, worn around the waist, became a functional and stylish addition, emphasizing the 80s trend for rocking bold accessories.
