        <h2>Paperbag jeans</h2>
        <p>Paperbag jeans are known for their high-waisted design and a gathered or folded waistline. They earned their
          name from the resemblance of the gathered waistband to the top of a paper bag, creating a playful and ‘puffy’
          silhouette. A popular way of styling them was pairing them with oversized, off-the-shoulder sweatshirts or
          slouchy sweaters, creating a relaxed yet stylish look. For a more polished and chic appearance, women often
          combined the jeans with fitted blouses or button-down shirts. </p>
