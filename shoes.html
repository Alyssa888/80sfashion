          Nevertheless, the red and the blue ones were the most popular. They were an important part of streetwear in
          the 80s. They were worn with rolled-up baggy jeans, tracksuits, and no-show socks.</p>

        <h2>Keds</h2>
        <p>These sneakers were a casual trend among both men and women. The canvas shoes with a rubber sole were seen as
          a symbol of comfort. They were worn with everyday attire such as
          denim jeans or shorts, graphic t-shirts. They could also be worn more preppy and sportier with tennis skirts
          or pleated skirts and paired with polo shirts or button-down blouses. The sneakers even became a huge hit for
          people who loved aerobics. You would see people with colorful leggings covered in bold patterns, and high-cut
          leotards. While white Keds were a classic, bold colors and even patterns began making their way to the big
          audience.
